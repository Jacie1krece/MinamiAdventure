	"DebowiecSasin15":"Well, well, if it isn't the cat and the android? Could you tell me where's that necklace?",
	"DebowiecSasin16":"(He means your necklace, Telar.)",
	"DebowiecSasin17":"Here it is, standing before you, wanting to \\}STRIKE YOU DOWN\\{!",
	"DebowiecSasin18":"Oh, he is stronger than I thought.",
	"DebowiecSasin19":"Guess that you really trained in the meantime. I gotta go, bye!",
	"DebowiecSasin20":"You again? Beating me one time really isn't enough for ya?",
	"DebowiecSasin21":"Yeah. Also, you did block our path, so we have no other way of progressing than beating you up.",
	"DebowiecSasin22":"Well then, if you defeat me again, I'll unlock the path. If not, you go home and don't disturb me!",
	"DebowiecSasin23":"You previously defeated me with such ease, and now you didn't make a scratch on me? Huh, guess I got a lot stronger.",
	"DebowiecSasin24":"Yeah, that's what I honestly expected. I go unblock your path.",
	
	"MaximilianPoster":"Help wanted",
	"MaximilianPoster1":"I got a little game demo from a friend to review, but I'm bad at video games. I want to help him, so, could someone help review that game? - Maximilian",
	"MaximilianPoster2":"That sounds quite sincere... What do you think, should we help him?",
	"MaximilianPoster3":"I vote for yes. Especially if that game has a bullet hell mechanic.",
	"MaximilianPoster4":"Kindness is important. I'm in.",
	"MaximilianPoster5":"I agree with Naemi.",
	"MaximilianPoster6":"Let's go then!",
	"MaximilianDoor1":"Entering someone's house without any reason isn't appropriate.",
	"MaximilianDoor2":"Come in!",
	"MaximilianDoor3":"I decided to adventure with you, Minami.",
	"MaximilianDoor4":"We're here to help you.",
	"MaximilianWelcome1":"Sorry for the inconvience, I'm Minami.",
	"MaximilianWelcome2":"Don't worry. I'm Maximilian.",
	"MaximilianWelcome3":"I watched many of your matches before and, honestly, I didn't think of you as someone who doesn't know how to play a game.",
	"MaximilianWelcome4":"Yeah, that's because I lied on the bulletin board. I actually finished that game, but I worry that my review will be biased, so I looked for someone who would give me a 100% sincere review of that game.",
	"MaximilianWelcome5":"Either way, we'll happily help you review it!",
	"MaximilianWelcome6":"Thanks! The PC is right there, I left the game on the menu screen. Have fun!",
	"MaximilianCheck1":"That's my kitchenette.",
	"MaximilianCheck2":"Behind the door are my bedroom and bathroom.",
	"MaximilianGame1":"Ok, let's play it!",
	"MaximilianGame2":"Maximilian, why it spawned us in this forest, without an introduction or anything?",
	"MaximilianGame3":"Probably he sent me a test build. Still, it's currently the main gameplay, so nothing of value is lost.",
	"MaximilianGame4":"And why this looks so... basic? Like it was from the engine's sample maps and characters?",
	"MaximilianGame5":"He didn't have any ideas for a game, so that's what he tests, hoping that some inspiration will shine for him.",
	"MaximilianGame6":"Hey, Maximilian, do you want to join our team when we're finished?",
	"MaximilianGame7":"That's a nice idea. For how long I'll be out of my home? I have a major tournament in a month.",
	"MaximilianGame8":"I think that my adventure will last for about a week, so don't worry about that.",
	"MaximilianGame9":"Great. Now, only beat the final boss of this area and you're finished with this.",
	"MaximilianGame10":"Aaah! Why that enemy appeared out of nowhere?!",
	"MaximilianGame11":"There are random encounters in this game. Don't worry, you should be fine... unless the game decides to spam these.",
	"MaximilianGame12":"Oh, I lost...",
	"MaximilianGame13":"Don't worry, just try it again.",
	"MaximilianGame14":"Ok, the game's beaten.",
	"MaximilianRating1":"(How do you rate Maximilian's game?)",
	"MaximilianRating2":"Great",
	"MaximilianRating3":"Good",
	"MaximilianRating4":"Mid",
	"MaximilianRating5":"Bad",
	"MaximilianRating6":"Shit",
	"MaximilianRating7":"It's a great start for a game already, and I know how to make it even better!",
	"MaximilianRating8":"Great! Might I hear your idea, so I can message my friend?",
	"MaximilianRating9":"It's good, but I have an idea how to make it even better.",
	"MaximilianRating10":"It seems like our opinion isn't different. Might I hear your idea to also tell my friend?",
	"MaximilianRating11":"Well, it definitely isn't the game of all time, but it's also not that bad. I also have an idea on how to improve it.",
	"MaximilianRating12":"Ok, so, can I hear your idea? I want to tell my friend about it.",
	"MaximilianRating13":"It definitely needs lots of work still done if your friend isn't creating shovelware. I have an idea for a theme, so at least he won't need to be burdened with that.",
	"MaximilianRating14":"Honestly, it's the truth. It still needs a lot of work and dedication. But, an already established theme will help, so can I hear your idea?",
	"MaximilianRating15":"It's shit. But, I also have my idea to at least make it themed shit.",
	"MaximilianRating16":"Huh. How helpful of you. Then, can I hear your idea?",
	"MaximilianRating17":"Yeah! So, what if this game was about my adventure? You'll play a part in it, and we'll tell you everything that happened prior, so your friend can make a great game.",
	"MaximilianRating18":"Yes. So, what if this game was about my adventure? You'll play a part in it, and we'll tell you everything that happened prior, so your friend can make a better game.",
	"MaximilianRating19":"That's... a nice idea. I'll ask my friend if he also thinks so.",
	"MaximilianScarlet1":"By the way, do you know something about Scarlet?",
	"MaximilianScarlet2":"Hmm... does she have bright red hair?",
	"MaximilianScarlet3":"Yes, she has red hair.",
	"MaximilianScarlet4":"Then I fought her recently on a ring. As for a new contender, she was fighting really well. And, oh, she left a few cosmetic burns on my gloves.",
	"MaximilianScarlet5":"Well, we are on our way to find her, so if you join, you will be able to fight her again!",
	"MaximilianScarlet6":"And, considering how I lost against her with a 1-2 score, it will be a great rematch! Let's go!",
	"MaximilianScarlet7":"<center><b>NEW ALLY UNLOCKED</b><br>Maximilian the Brawler</center>",
	"MaximilianScarlet8":"Oh, and also, I have found something recently. Maybe we'll find the use for that later.",
	
	"AmberPeaksBerries":"Oh look, berries!",
	"AmberPeaksBus1":"A bus stop.",
	"AmberPeaksBus2":"This is the final destination, so this can only make us backtrack. Also, I prefer Stephen's drones.",
	"AmberPeaksReed":"Hey, there is a bunch of balloons in these reeds!",
	"AmberPeaksSign1":"\"This passage is blocked due to protective measures. Light up the 4 lamps in the Peaks to unlock the gate.\"",

	"DoremyResponse1":"...I just had a weird dream.",

	"DoremyResponseGenijro":"Basically, I think that that mysterious blue-haired girl uses a technique called \"Magical Storage Transfer\" that allows her to send these stat boosters to these who she visits in their sleep. Pretty clever!",
