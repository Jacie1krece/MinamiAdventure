	"Chara.Minami.Profile2": "Accidental Necromancer - What in the world was in that neacklace that allowed this to work?",
	"Chara.Minami.Profile3": "Party Leader - She's the one in charge of this team, even if not currently fighting.'",
	"Chara.Minami.Birthday": "25th June",
	"Chara.Minami.Bio": "Minami was born a catgirl due to a lab blunder. Due to that, she possesses many cat-like traits, for example, ears, whiskers, a tail, and the ability to meow, while still being a well-functioning human. She is mischievous, friendly, and so brutally honest that she'll not only say directly what she thinks, but also that she's just unable to lie. Also, while she likes things like holding a hand or petting, pulling her tail isn't appreciated.",
	"Naemi": "Naemi",
	"Chara.Naemi.Class": "Android",
	"Chara.Naemi.Profile1": "Android - Some can say that she's too robotic, but she doesn't care. They won't build a better robot than her anyway.",
	"Chara.Naemi.Bio": "Naemi was, at first, created as a robotic assistant only to later become Genjiro's sister. She's sentient, able to learn (even if it takes lots of tries), think, and access information on the internet. But, despite all these achievements, she isn't perfect at all, an example being her voice still sounding very robotic. But are they bugs, if Naemi can modify her code and still refuses to fix that? As an informatical proverb says, \"It's not a bug it's a feature\".",
	"Chara.Naemi.Birthday": "17th August",
	"Telar": "Telar",
	"Chara.Telar.Class": "Flügel",
	"Chara.Telar.Profile1": "Resurrected - Even after dying over a hundred years ago, it cannot be said that she is restarting from zero.",
	"Chara.Telar.Profile2": "Idea giver - It was her idea to embark on this adventure to reunite with Scarlet. A Scarlet Quest, if you will.",
	"Chara.Telar.Birthday": "18th October",
	"Chara.Telar.Bio": "Telar spent most of her childhood in the Steam Nation due to her parents having an important task to do in there, which took them over 15 years, meaning that Telar was an adult when they finished. At some point, she decided to start a new nation in the Great Desert, which was fairly successful - however, she got backstabbed by some bandits. Now that she's alive again, she wants to reunite with her childhood friend, Scarlet.",
	"Genjiro": "Genjiro",
	"Chara.Genjiro.Class": "Inventor",
	"Chara.Genjiro.Profile1": "Inventor - He invented many things, some that can help humanity and some that could annihilate it if they fell in the wrong hands.",
	"Chara.Genjiro.Birthday": "18th April",
	"Chara.Genjiro.Bio": "Genjiro is a part of the latest generation of the Okimoto family, so he naturally has a talent for inventing things - and a strong affiliation with electricity. Knowing Minami since childhood, he and Stephen are always ready to help with whatever she thinks of - but that doesn't mean he doesn't invent weird things by himself. While he has a workstation in his room, he prefers to invent new things in his basement - especially if that thing could get dangerous in wrong hands.",
	"Maximilian": "Maximilian",
	"Chara.Maximilian.Class": "Brawler",
	"Chara.Maximilian.Profile1": "Professional brawler - He won many times, he lost even more times, and in both cases, he'll congratulate the opponent, as he's a chill guy.",
	"Chara.Maximilian.Birthday": "23th Febuary",
	"Chara.Maximilian.Bio": "Maximilian is pretty known for the entire world, as he was in various boxing contests around the world. Due to years of training, his punches and blocks are both as excellent as they can be. After being defeated by a mysterious, red-haired girl at the last match, he now waits for the next big tournament.",

	"Trait.Race.CatgirlDesc": "Cathumans were anime's and the internet's domain until 16 years ago when the first catgirl ever - Minami - was born. The main features of this race are cat ears, tail, and whiskers.",
	"Trait.Race.AndroidDesc": "Androids are mostly a thing of science fiction, but 6 years ago was the first boot of the first sentient machine. The main feature of this race is, obviously, the machinery that is inside.",
	"Trait.Race.FlugelDesc": "Flügels arrived from an unknown place, ending the medieval times. All Flügels that are alive today belong to the Jriaed family. The main feature of this race is the wings and the long lifespan.",
