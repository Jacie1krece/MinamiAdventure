# Minami's Adventure
Hello, and welcome to this preview build of Minami's Adventure, the game that I'm making (and was thinking about for so long)!
This is still an early project, though it has slightly over a year, and I recently decided to make it public so anyone can see that there's something like that in the works.
## What is it
Minami's Adventure is a turn-based RPG game, containing fun characters, various mechanics to spice up the gameplay, and especially a whole lot of various references - to a whole lot of stuff!
As of version v0.1.0, the following content is avaliable:
### Characters
<details><summary><b>Minami</b></summary>The main protagonist. She's a catgirl, and she's not silent at all!</details>
<details><summary><b>Naemi</b></summary>Minami's best friend's robotic 'sister', her main role is to assist... though she's good in combat as well.</details>
<details><summary><b>Telar</b></summary>Dead for a long time, thank to the power of (her own) Amber Necklace, Minami is able to (accidentally) resurrect her.</details>
<details><summary><b>Genjiro</b></summary>Minami's best friend, he's an inventor gifted with a whole lot of electrical powers.</details>
<details><summary><b>Maximilian</b></summary>The first (and currently only) ally, his punches hit hard, making tanky targets less of a challenge.</details>

### Locations
<details><summary><b>Nijisaki City</b></summary>The starter town, where you can rest buy some items and exchange your Rainbow Stars.</details>
<details><summary><b>The Great Desert</b></summary>There's a whole lot of bandits here, while Minami and Naemi want to go return the Amber Necklace where it belongs.</details>
<details><summary><b>Mineral Nation</b></summary><b>WARNING: Not reworked to the new leveling system yet, might experience some wonkiness or unbalanced fights</b> The real adventure starts here! Explore the underground mines, the labirynth of the Coal Forest, and the little puzzles of the Amber Mountains.</details>

## Downloading
This code right here isn't able to be run without RPG Maker MZ, but in Releases, there's a .zip file containing the actual game, ready to be played.
